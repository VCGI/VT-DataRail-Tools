# VT-DataRail-Tools
VT DataRail Tools are tools that support sharing and exchange of geospatial-data resources per the VT EGC (Enterprise GIS Consortium) Geospatial Data Exchange Protocol.

The tools are built with arcpyâ€“via ArcGIS Desktop 10.6.1 and Python 2.7.14.

Read the VT EGC Geospatial Data Exchange Protocol for important background information, protocol requirements, and definitions (hub, spoke, push, pull, etc.).

Each tool is either a script tool that is run via the toolbox VT DataRail Tools.tbx or a stand-alone script that should be run directly in Python.

See the readme.txt file in the .zip folder's root for more info.
